The significance of understanding the meaning of one's dreams, and their impact on
one's decision making is not well understood. There are disparate, often
conflicting schools of thought on whether or not there is benefit in 
understanding the content of a dream. So why Remalize?

While it is unclear whether dreams have far-reaching connections to our 
mental state or hold prophetic power for what is to come, what is clear is 
that dreams can be a source for solutions to real-world problems. Numerous 
examples are given where a person dreams, draws connections to a real-
world situation, and makes decisions inspired by the dream. 

Examples:
1. *Structure of Benzene*: The ratio of hydrogen and carbon atoms in Benzene is
unlike other hydrocarbon atoms known at the time of August kekule. When he fell
asleep working on the problem one night, he dreamed of a snake eating its own 
tail. He realized Benzene atoms are made of rings of carbon atoms. 
2. *Frankenstein*: Stuck indoors in the cold volcanic winter of 1816, Mary 
Shelley dreams of a student reviving a corpse. [Reference]
3. *Yesterday*: Paul McCartney composed the entire melody in a dream. [Reference] 
4. *Structure of the Atom*: Neils Bohr, stumped about which configurations
make sense for structural integrity of atoms in his experiments, dreams of
electrons spinning about the atom. 
5. *Srinivasan Ramanujan*: A mathematician who made important contributions, he 
often got inspiration for math formulas in dreams. 
6. *The Scientific Method*: Rene Descartes dreamed the main ideas of the 
Scientific Method in Nov, 1619. 

This is just the beginning. Other examples include Google, the theory of 
Relativity, the Periodic table, Dali's Persistence of Memory and the Terminator.

Dreams seem to be capable of organizing and consolidating ideas, images, 
memories and bits of information that we gather during our waking lives. 

But dreams don't have to lead to inventions and scientific discoveries to be 
useful. They can offer a different perspective on past trauma, ideas to 
improve relationships, and inspiration on what to work on next. 

Sometimes the perspective, the idea, or the inspiration is unclear. That's why
we created Remalize. Turns out that by following a curated process, one can 
dig deeper into the content of a dream, and using a combination of the context
of one's own life, as well as databases of information on what dream symbols 
have meant to various people across various times and cultures, it's possible 
to find an interpretation that resonates with the dreamer. 

Whether or not the interpretation is real is meaningless. If you can walk away
with a more constructive perspective on aspects of your life, Remalize will 
have succeeded. 

### Method
Remalize uses a version of Jungian analysis of one's dream. 
Record dream -> make associations -> connect dream to waking life -> interpret ->
ritualize   

### Dream dictionaries
We generally don't recommend using dream dictionaries, becasue dream symbols
are unique to you. The exception here is for archetypes, which tend to have 
common roles across the human race (ex: trickster, king, pauper, father, mother).
Dream databases for archetypes can be useful to help you form associations that
resonate with you. 

But these are simply suggestions. If a 'father' means priest to you more than 
it means the biological father, then go with what resonates.
